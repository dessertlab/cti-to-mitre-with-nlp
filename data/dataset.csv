179,T1550,T1550.001,Application Access Token,Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud-based applications and software-as-a-service .
180,T1550,T1550.001,Application Access Token,OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems.
181,T1550,T1550.001,Application Access Token,These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform.
182,T1550,T1550.001,Application Access Token,"Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user."
183,T1550,T1550.001,Application Access Token,"Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application."
184,T1550,T1550.001,Application Access Token,"For example, with a cloud-based email service once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a ""refresh"" token enabling background access is awarded."
185,T1550,T1550.001,Application Access Token,With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.
186,T1550,T1550.001,Application Access Token,Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services.
187,T1550,T1550.001,Application Access Token,"For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines."
188,T1550,T1550.001,Application Access Token,Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords.
189,T1550,T1550.001,Application Access Token,"Access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow."
190,T1550,T1550.001,Application Access Token,"APT28 has used several malicious applications that abused OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts, including Gmail and Yahoo Mail."

3032,T1499,T1499,Endpoint Denial of Service,Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet.
3033,T1499,T1499,Endpoint Denial of Service,"In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources."
3034,T1499,T1499,Endpoint Denial of Service,"Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks."
3035,T1499,T1499,Endpoint Denial of Service,"In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the the global network  where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume."
3036,T1499,T1499,Endpoint Denial of Service,This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.

3041,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,Adversaries may environmentally key payloads or other features of malware to evade defenses and constraint execution to a specific target environment.
3042,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.
3043,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,Environmental keying is an implementation of Execution Guardrails that utilizes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment.
3044,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,Values can be derived from target-specific elements and used to generate a decryption key for an encrypted payload.
3045,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,"Target-specific values can be derived from specific network shares, physical devices, software/software versions, files, joined AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses."
3046,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,"By generating the decryption keys from target-specific environmental values, environmental keying can make sandbox detection, anti-virus detection, crowdsourcing of information, and reverse engineering difficult."
3047,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,"These difficulties can slow down the incident response process and help adversaries hide their tactics, techniques, and procedures ."
3048,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,"Similar to Obfuscated Files or Information, adversaries may use environmental keying to help protect their TTPs and evade detection."
3049,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,Environmental keying may be used to deliver an encrypted payload to the target that will use target-specific values to decrypt the payload before execution.
3050,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,By utilizing target-specific values to decrypt the payload the adversary can avoid packaging the decryption key with the payload or sending it over a potentially monitored network connection.
3051,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,"Depending on the technique for gathering target-specific values, reverse engineering of the encrypted payload can be exceptionally difficult."

3062,T1611,T1611,Escape to Host,"In principle, containerized resources should provide a clear separation of application functionality and be isolated from the host environment."
3063,T1611,T1611,Escape to Host,There are multiple ways an adversary may escape to a host environment.
3064,T1611,T1611,Escape to Host,"Examples include creating a container configured to mount the host’s filesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the host, or utilizing a privileged container to run commands on the underlying host."
3065,T1611,T1611,Escape to Host,"Adversaries may also escape via Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in global symbolic links in order to access the root directory of a host machine."
3066,T1611,T1611,Escape to Host,"Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host."

7674,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the /proc filesystem in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
7675,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
7676,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,Proc memory injection involves enumerating the memory of a process via the /proc filesystem  then crafting a return-oriented programming  payload with available gadgets/instructions.
7677,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,"Each running process has its own directory, which includes memory mappings."
7678,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’ stack using memory mappings provided by the /proc filesystem.
7679,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,This information can be used to enumerate offsets  and gadgets  otherwise hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout randomization .
7680,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,"Once enumerated, the target processes’ memory map within /proc/pid/maps can be overwritten using dd."
7681,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,Other techniques such as Dynamic Linker Hijacking may be used to populate a target process with more available gadgets.
7682,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,"Similar to Process Hollowing, proc memory injection may target child processes ."
7683,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,Execution via proc memory injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

* Transact – Create a TxF transaction using a legitimate executable then overwrite the file with malicious code."
7905,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,These changes will be isolated and only visible within the context of the transaction.
7906,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,* Load – Create a shared section of memory and load the malicious executable.
7907,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"* Rollback – Undo changes to original executable, effectively removing malicious code from the file system."
7908,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,* Animate – Create a process from the tainted section of memory and initiate execution.
7909,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from  of the injecting process.

7915,T1055,T1055.012,Process Hollowing,Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
7916,T1055,T1055.012,Process Hollowing,"Process hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process in a suspended state then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code."
7917,T1055,T1055.012,Process Hollowing,"A victim process can be created with native Windows API calls such as CreateProcess, which includes a flag to suspend the processes primary thread."
7918,T1055,T1055.012,Process Hollowing,"At this point the process can be unmapped using APIs calls such as ZwUnmapViewOfSection or NtUnmapViewOfSection  before being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, SetThreadContext, then ResumeThread respectively."
7919,T1055,T1055.012,Process Hollowing,This is very similar to Thread Local Storage but creates a new process rather than targeting an existing process.
7920,T1055,T1055.012,Process Hollowing,"However, execution via process hollowing may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process."

8264,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,"Reflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack."
8265,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers.
8266,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,"The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume."
8267,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,"Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS and NTP, though the use of several others in the wild have been documented."

8272,T1620,T1620,Reflective Code Loading,Reflective code injection is very similar to Process Injection except that the “injection” loads code into the processes’ own memory instead of that of a separate process.
8273,T1620,T1620,Reflective Code Loading,Reflective loading may evade process-based detections since the execution of the arbitrary code may be masked within a legitimate or otherwise benign process.
8274,T1620,T1620,Reflective Code Loading,"Reflectively loading payloads directly into memory may also avoid creating files or other artifacts on disk, while also enabling malware to keep these payloads encrypted  until execution."

11335,T1053,T1053.006,Systemd Timers,Timers can be set to run on a calendar event or after a time span relative to a starting point.
11336,T1053,T1053.006,Systemd Timers,They can be used as an alternative to Cron in Linux environments.
11337,T1053,T1053.006,Systemd Timers,"Systemd timers may be activated remotely via the systemctl command line utility, which operates over SSH."
11338,T1053,T1053.006,Systemd Timers,"Each .timer file must have a corresponding .service file with the same name, e.g., example.timer and example.service."
11339,T1053,T1053.006,Systemd Timers,.service files are Systemd Service unit files that are managed by the systemd system and service manager.
11340,T1053,T1053.006,Systemd Timers,Privileged timers are written to /etc/systemd/system/ and /usr/lib/systemd/system while user level are written to ~/.config/systemd/user/.
11341,T1053,T1053.006,Systemd Timers,An adversary may use systemd timers to execute malicious code at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.
11342,T1053,T1053.006,Systemd Timers,Timers installed using privileged paths may be used to maintain root level persistence.
11343,T1053,T1053.006,Systemd Timers,Adversaries may also install user level timers to achieve user level persistence.
11344,T1542,T1542.005,TFTP Boot,Adversaries may abuse netbooting to load an unauthorized network device operating system from a Trivial File Transfer Protocol  server.
11345,T1542,T1542.005,TFTP Boot,TFTP boot  is commonly used by network administrators to load configuration-controlled network device images from a centralized management server.
11346,T1542,T1542.005,TFTP Boot,"Netbooting is one option in the boot sequence and can be used to centralize, manage, and control device images."
11347,T1542,T1542.005,TFTP Boot,"Adversaries may manipulate the configuration on the network device specifying use of a malicious TFTP server, which may be used in conjunction with Modify System Image to load a modified image on device startup or reset."
11348,T1542,T1542.005,TFTP Boot,"The unauthorized image allows adversaries to modify device configuration, add malicious capabilities to the device, and introduce backdoors to maintain control of the network device while minimizing detection through use of a standard functionality."

11350,T1080,T1080,Taint Shared Content,"Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories."
11351,T1080,T1080,Taint Shared Content,"Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files."
11352,T1080,T1080,Taint Shared Content,"Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system."
11353,T1080,T1080,Taint Shared Content,Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.
11354,T1080,T1080,Taint Shared Content,A directory share pivot is a variation on this technique that uses several other techniques to propagate malware when users access a shared network directory.
11355,T1080,T1080,Taint Shared Content,"It uses Shortcut Modification of directory .LNK files that use Masquerading to look like the real directories, which are hidden through Hidden Files and Directories."
11356,T1080,T1080,Taint Shared Content,The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs.
11357,T1080,T1080,Taint Shared Content,"When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts."
11358,T1080,T1080,Taint Shared Content,Adversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory.
11359,T1080,T1080,Taint Shared Content,The malware may modify the original entry point  of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code.
11360,T1080,T1080,Taint Shared Content,The infection could continue to spread via the newly infected file when it is executed by a remote system.
11361,T1080,T1080,Taint Shared Content,"These infections may target both binary and non-binary formats that end with extensions including, but not limited to, .EXE, .DLL, .SCR, .BAT, and/or .VBS."

11580,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task."
11581,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control.
11582,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports  Port Knocking, but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics."
11583,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software."
11584,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value."
11585,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable Network Device Authentication for standard services offered by the device such as telnet."

11699,T1546,T1546.004,Unix Shell Configuration Modification,These files typically require root permissions to modify and are executed each time any shell on a system launches.
11700,T1546,T1546.004,Unix Shell Configuration Modification,"For user level permissions, adversaries can insert malicious commands into ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile which are sourced when a user opens a command-line interface or connects remotely."
11701,T1546,T1546.004,Unix Shell Configuration Modification,"Since the system only executes the first existing file in the listed order, adversaries have used ~/.bash_profile to ensure execution."
11702,T1546,T1546.004,Unix Shell Configuration Modification,"Adversaries have also leveraged the ~/.bashrc file which is additionally executed if the connection is established remotely or an additional interactive shell is opened, such as a new tab in the command-line interface."
11703,T1546,T1546.004,Unix Shell Configuration Modification,"Some malware targets the termination of a program to trigger execution, adversaries can use the ~/.bash_logout file to execute malicious commands at the end of a session."
11704,T1546,T1546.004,Unix Shell Configuration Modification,"For macOS, the functionality of this technique is similar but may leverage zsh, the default shell for macOS 10.15+."
11705,T1546,T1546.004,Unix Shell Configuration Modification,"When the Terminal.app is opened, the application launches a zsh login shell and a zsh interactive shell."
11706,T1546,T1546.004,Unix Shell Configuration Modification,"The login shell configures the system environment using /etc/profile, /etc/zshenv, /etc/zprofile, and /etc/zlogin."
11707,T1546,T1546.004,Unix Shell Configuration Modification,The login shell then configures the user environment with ~/.zprofile and ~/.zlogin.
11708,T1546,T1546.004,Unix Shell Configuration Modification,The interactive shell uses the ~/.zshrc to configure the user environment.
11709,T1546,T1546.004,Unix Shell Configuration Modification,"Upon exiting, /etc/zlogout and ~/.zlogout are executed."
11710,T1546,T1546.004,Unix Shell Configuration Modification,"For legacy programs, macOS executes /etc/bashrc on startup."

11714,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,Adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection.
11715,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,Access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure.
11716,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,"Cloud service providers often provide infrastructure throughout the world in order to improve performance, provide redundancy, and allow customers to meet compliance requirements."
11717,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,"Oftentimes, a customer will only use a subset of the available regions and may not actively monitor other regions."
11718,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,"If an adversary creates resources in an unused region, they may be able to operate undetected."
11719,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,A variation on this behavior takes advantage of differences in functionality across cloud regions.
11720,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,An adversary could utilize regions which do not support advanced detection services in order to avoid detection of their activity.
11721,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,"An example of adversary use of unused AWS regions is to mine cryptocurrency through Resource Hijacking, which can cost organizations substantial amounts of money over time depending on the processing power used."
11722,T1608,T1608.001,Upload Malware,Adversaries may upload malware to third-party or adversary controlled infrastructure to make it accessible during targeting.

11736,T1608,T1608.002,Upload Tool,"Tools can also be staged on web services, such as an adversary controlled GitHub repo."
11737,T1608,T1608.002,Upload Tool,"Adversaries can avoid the need to upload a tool by having compromised victim machines download the tool directly from a third-party hosting location , including the original hosting site of the tool."
11738,T1608,T1608.002,Upload Tool,"Threat Group-3390 has staged tools, including gsecdump and WCE, on previously compromised websites."
11739,T1550,T1550,Use Alternate Authentication Material,"Adversaries may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls."
11740,T1550,T1550,Use Alternate Authentication Material,Authentication processes generally require a valid identity  along with one or more authentication factors .
11741,T1550,T1550,Use Alternate Authentication Material,Alternate authentication material is legitimately generated by systems after a user or application successfully authenticates by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor.
11742,T1550,T1550,Use Alternate Authentication Material,Alternate authentication material may also be generated during the identity creation process.
11743,T1550,T1550,Use Alternate Authentication Material,Caching alternate authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor.
11744,T1550,T1550,Use Alternate Authentication Material,Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either in memory or on disk—it may be at risk of being stolen through Credential Access techniques.
11745,T1550,T1550,Use Alternate Authentication Material,"By stealing alternate authentication material, adversaries are able to bypass system access controls and authenticate to systems without knowing the plaintext password or any additional authentication factors."
11746,T1550,T1550,Use Alternate Authentication Material,"UNC2452 used forged SAML tokens that allowed the actors to impersonate users and bypass MFA, enabling UNC2452 to access enterprise cloud applications and services."

11755,T1204,T1204,User Execution,An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution.
11756,T1204,T1204,User Execution,"Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link."
11757,T1204,T1204,User Execution,These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of Phishing.
11758,T1204,T1204,User Execution,"While User Execution frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it."
11759,T1204,T1204,User Execution,Magic Hound has attempted to get users to execute malware via social media and spearphishing emails.
11760,T1564,T1564.007,VBA Stomping,Adversaries may hide malicious Visual Basic for Applications  payloads embedded within MS Office documents by replacing the VBA source code with benign data.
11761,T1564,T1564.007,VBA Stomping,MS Office documents with embedded VBA content store source code inside of module streams.
11762,T1564,T1564.007,VBA Stomping,Each module stream has a PerformanceCache that stores a separate compiled version of the VBA source code known as p-code.
11763,T1564,T1564.007,VBA Stomping,The p-code is executed when the MS Office version specified in the _VBA_PROJECT stream  matches the version of the host MS Office application.
11764,T1564,T1564.007,VBA Stomping,"An adversary may hide malicious VBA code by overwriting the VBA source code location with zero’s, benign code, or random bytes while leaving the previously compiled malicious p-code."
11765,T1564,T1564.007,VBA Stomping,Tools that scan for malicious VBA source code may be bypassed as the unwanted code is hidden in the compiled p-code.
11766,T1564,T1564.007,VBA Stomping,"If the VBA source code is removed, some tools might even think that there are no macros present."
11767,T1564,T1564.007,VBA Stomping,"If there is a version match between the _VBA_PROJECT stream and host MS Office application, the p-code will be executed, otherwise the benign VBA source code will be decompressed and recompiled to p-code, thus removing malicious p-code and potentially bypassing dynamic analysis."
11768,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via VDSO hijacking in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
11769,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,Virtual dynamic shared object  hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
11770,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,VDSO hijacking involves redirecting calls to dynamically linked shared libraries.
11771,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,Memory protections may prevent writing executable code to a process via Ptrace System Calls.
11772,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,"However, an adversary may hijack the syscall interface code stubs mapped into a process from the vdso shared object to execute syscalls to open and map a malicious shared object."
11773,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,This code can then be invoked by redirecting the execution flow of the process via patched memory address references stored in a process' global offset table .
11774,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,Execution via VDSO hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
11775,T1021,T1021.005,VNC,Adversaries may use Valid Accounts to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing .
11776,T1021,T1021.005,VNC,"VNC is a platform-independent desktop sharing system that uses the RFB  protocol to enable users to remotely control another computer’s display by relaying the screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs over the network."
11777,T1021,T1021.005,VNC,VNC differs from Remote Desktop Protocol as VNC is screen-sharing software rather than resource-sharing software.
11778,T1021,T1021.005,VNC,"By default, VNC uses the system's authentication, but it can be configured to use credentials specific to VNC."
